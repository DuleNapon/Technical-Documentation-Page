            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms, with dynamic styling, with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich. JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more! JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:</p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles, collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
              <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
              <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's outside the scope of this article -as a light introduction to JavaScript- to present the details of how the core JavaScript language is different from the tools listed above.
    <br>
    <br>
    The section below introduces some aspects of the core language and offers an opportunity to play with a few browser API features too. Have fun!</p>

          <header class="title">Hello world!</header>
            
            <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.
    <br>
    <br>
    However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example. (Hello world! is the standard for introductory programming examples.)</p>
            <ol class="list">
              <li>
                Go to your test site and create a new folder named <code>scripts</code>. Within the scripts folder, create a new text document called <code>main.js</code> and save it.</li> 
              <br>
              <li>In your <code>index.html</code> file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing <code>&lt/body&gt</code> tag:
              <br>
              <br>
                <div class="code-text">
                  <code>
                    &ltscript src="scripts/main.js"&gt&lt/script&gt
                  </code>
                </div>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>This is doing the same job as the <code>&ltlink&gt</code> element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).</li>
              <br>
              <li>Add this code to the <code>main.js</code> file:
              <br>
              <br>
                <div class="code-text">
                  <code>
                    const myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');<br>
                    myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!';
                  </code>
                </div>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load <code>index.html</code> in your browser. You should see something like this:
                <br>
                <br>
                <div id="image" >
                  <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics/hello-world.png">
                </div>
              </li>
            </ol>
          
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
          <header class="title">Variables</header>
            
            <p>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
              <div class="code-text">
                <code>
                  let myVariable;
                </code>
              </div>
            </p>
            <p>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement.</p>
              
              
            <p>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems in your code, check the case!
            </p>
              <br>
              <br>
            <p>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:
            </p>
              <div class="code-text">
                <code>
                  myVariable = 'Bob';
                </code>
              </div>
              
            <p>Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:
            </p>
      
              
              <div class="code-text">
                <code>
                  let myVariable = 'Bob';
                </code>
              </div>
              
              <p>You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:</p>
              
              <div class="code-text">
                <code>
                  myVariable;
                </code>
              </div>
              
              <p>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:</p>
              
              <div class="code-text">
                <code>
                  let myVariable = 'Bob';<br>
                  myVariable = 'Steve';
                </code>
              </div>
              
              <p>Note that variables may hold values that have different data types:</p>
              
              <div class="table">
                <table class="standard-table">

                        <td>
                          This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                          <code>let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');</code><br>All of the above examples too.

              </div>
              <p>So why do we need variables? Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change an image displayed in an image gallery.</p>
          
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
          <header class="title">Comments</header>
            
            <p>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:</p>
            <div class="code-text">
              <code>/*<br><br>Everything in between is a comment.<br><br>*/</code>
            </div>
            <p>If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:</p>
            <div class="code-text">
              <code>// This is a comment</code>
            </div>
          
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Operators">
          <header class="title">Operators</header>
            
            <p>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). In the following table, you can see some of the simplest operators, along with some examples to try in the JavaScript console.</p>
            <div class="table">

                      This performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a
                      <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> (Boolean) result.
                    </td>

                    <th scope="row">Not, Does-not-equal</th>
                    <td>
                      This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns
                      a <code>true</code> into a <code>false</code>, etc.. When it is used
                      alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two
                      values are <em>not</em> equal.

                    <td><code>!</code>, <code>!==</code></td>

                      <p>
                        For "Not", the basic expression is <code>true</code>, but the
                        comparison returns <code>false</code> because we negate it:
                      </p>
                      <p><code>let myVariable = 3;<br>!(myVariable === 3);</code></p>
                      <p>
                        "Does-not-equal" gives basically the same result with different
                        syntax. Here we are testing "is <code>myVariable</code> NOT equal to
                        3". This returns<code> false</code> because <code>myVariable</code> IS
                        equal to 3:
                      </p>
                      <p><code>let myVariable = 3;<br>myVariable !== 3;</code></p>

              </table>

            <p>There are a lot more operators to explore, but this is enough for now. See Expressions and operators for a complete list.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Conditionals">
          <header class="title">Conditionals</header>
            
            <p>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the <code>if...else statement</code>. For example:</p>
            <div class="code-text">
              <code>let iceCream = 'chocolate';<br>
                    if(iceCream === 'chocolate') {<br>
                      alert('Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!');<br>
                    } else {<br>
                      alert('Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite…');<br>
                    }</code>
            </div>
            <p>The expression inside the <code>if()</code> is the test. This uses the strict equality operator (as described above) to compare the variable <code>iceCream</code> with the string <code>chocolate</code> to see if the two are equal. If this comparison returns <code>true</code>, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second block of code-after the <code>else</code> statement-runs instead.</p>

          <header class="title">Functions</header>
            
            <p>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code. You have already seen some uses of functions. For example:</p>
            <div class="code-text">
              <code>let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');</code>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="code-text">
              <code>alert('hello!');</code>
            </div>
            <p>These functions, <code>document.querySelector</code> and <code>alert</code>, are built into the browser.<br><br>
              If you see something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses - <code>()</code> - it is likely a function. Functions often take arguments: bits of data they need to do their job. Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.<br><br>
    
    For example, the <code>alert()</code> function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but we need to give it a string as an argument to tell the function what message to display.<br><br>
    
    You can also define your own functions. In the next example, we create a simple function which takes two numbers as arguments and multiplies them:
            </p>
            <div class="code-text">
              <code>function multiply(num1,num2) {<br>
                    let result = num1 * num2;<br>
                    return result;<br>
                    }
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>Try running this in the console; then test with several arguments. For example:</p>
            <div class="code-text">
              <code>multiply(4, 7);<br>
                    multiply(20, 20);<br>
                    multiply(0.5, 3);<br>
              </code>
            </div>
          
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Events">
          <header class="title">Events</header>
            
            <p>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse. To demonstrate this, enter the following into your console, then click on the current webpage:</p>
            <div class="code-text">
              <code>
                document.querySelector('html').addEventListener('click', function () {<br>
                alert('Ouch! Stop poking me!');<br>
                });
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>There are many ways to attach an event handler to an element. Here we select the <code>&lthtml&gt</code> element. We then call its <code>addEventListener()</code> function, passing in the name of the event to listen to (<code>'click'</code>) and a function to run when the event happens.
            <br>
            <br>
              Note that
            </p>
            <div class="code-text">
              <code>
                document.querySelector('html').addEventListener('click', function () {<br>
                alert('Ouch! Stop poking me!');<br>
                });
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>is equivalent to</p>
            <div class="code-text">
              <code>
                let myHTML = document.querySelector('html');<br>
                myHTML.addEventListener('click', function () {<br>
                alert('Ouch! Stop poking me!');<br>
                });
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>It's just shorter.</p>
            <p>The functions we just passed to <code>addEventListener()</code> here are called anonymous functions, because they don't have a name. There's an alternative way of writing anonymous functions, which we call an arrow function. An arrow function uses <code>() =></code> instead of <code>function ()</code>:</p>
            <div class="code-text">
              <code>
                document.querySelector('html').addEventListener('click', () => {<br>
                alert('Ouch! Stop poking me!');<br>
                });
              </code>
            </div>
          
        </section>
      </main>
